The Troll King stands over you, invincible and merciless, like the very darkness that has engulfed this world. His cold gaze pierces through you like an icy blade. The Sword of Dawn lies shattered into fragments. Along with it, your last hopes—those that could have saved Elvion from inevitable doom—have been broken as well.

The land begins to sink into eternal night—boundless, cold, and ruthless. The story has ended, leaving behind only the silent trace of shattered dreams. And the darkness—the most dreadful, the bleakest silence—has become the final witness to your defeat.
