Your fingers tremble as they touch the hilt. It’s cold, but not lifeless — like a sleeping stone with a spark of something still alive deep within. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, slowly, the metal begins to glow. Like a sunrise breaking the horizon, a warm radiance spills from within the blade, pushing back the darkness around you.

This is the Sword of Dawn — the legendary weapon spoken of in faded tales and broken whispers. Its blade doesn’t merely shine; it glows from within, as if it has trapped the light of morning skies. Every groove, every mark etched into the steel tells a story — not of weakness, but of resilience.

As you lift the sword, the cavern falls silent. It’s as if the stone itself is listening. And in that stillness, you understand: this is no ordinary weapon. It carries the will of the fallen and the hope of the living. It is the answer to the darkness.
