You stand in the deepest heart of the Troll Cave — where silence weighs heavier than stone, and the air is thick with the scent of ancient magic and long-forgotten fears. In your hand pulses the Sword of Dawn, burning with living fire, as if the very lifeblood of the world flows through its blade. It is no mere weapon — it is a beacon of hope, shining brighter than the blackest night.

Before you lies the Troll King — fallen and broken. His once vast shadow, which loomed over this land, has scattered like dust in a stormwind. The dark power that tormented Elvion for so many years has lost its grip and shall never return to smother the light.
