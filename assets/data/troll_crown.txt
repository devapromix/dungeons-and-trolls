You lean over the fallen tyrant’s body. Amid shattered bones and torn robes lies the crown — crude, heavy, and dark as the cave itself. It wasn’t crafted by the hands of jewelers, but forged by force and hatred built up over centuries. Each jagged spike looks like a shard broken from the silence of night.

When you touch the metal, you feel it — not warmth, but weight. It isn’t an ornament; it’s a burden of power, the embodiment of wild strength that kept generations in fear. Deep inside, like a dying ember, something still flickers… faint and cold. And you realize: this is not just a crown — it is a symbol of ruin.
